The purpose of this project is to create a functional gravity
calculator.  At the very least it should be an exercise which will
provide a basic terminal type interface to the user to calculate the
amount of time it will take an object to fall.

Main objectives: 

Collect information from a user through a text prompt.  Accurately
perform calculations of and present results of an object accellerated
due to gravitational forces assuming them to be as obsered on the
earth's surface.
