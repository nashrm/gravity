**Determine your formulas to use.. ala position as a function of time
   based upon gravitational excelleration, amount of time required to
   reach certain distances.  Consider if you want to include a
   terminal velocity or initial velocity cases.
   
**Get a list of unit conversion ratios to build in -- 

**Gravity will be assumed to work along one axis only and we will
   consider 2D cases only

**Ideally we should have a set of operations we can run which will
   answer questions like the following.... 
***how long will it take to fall 500ft?
***how far will a ball travel if we throw it such a way?
